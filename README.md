Hi, I'm Nirushan! I'm passionate about software engineering, AI, and machine learning. I love diving into new challenges and building side projects that help me apply and expand the skills I’ve recently learned. Coding is more than just a hobby for me; it's something I genuinely enjoy and get excited about every day. I'm always eager to learn and take on new opportunities to grow as a developer!
